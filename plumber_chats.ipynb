Check out this detailed cost guide on unblocking a toilet.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReady to get a price for your job?\\nGet Prices \\n\\n\\nHow Much Does it Cost to Unblock a Toilet?\\nSome of the most common call-out jobs for plumbers include blocked toilets and broken pipes, which need \\r\\naddressing quickly so that further damage isn’t caused.\\nTypically, plumbers charge a flat-rate for the first call-out to a property, usually charged at 30 minutes to assess the issue.\\nAssuming a minor blockage within a toilet, and not the connecting pipework or hidden cistern, \\r\\nunblocking can take as little as 30 minutes, usually at a charge of around £30 - £60, \\r\\nthough it can be more if you live in London or the surrounding boroughs. \\nMore complicated or severe blockages will incur a greater cost of around £200 if there are additional underlaying \\r\\nissues that need to be addressed.\\nUnblocking Toilet Prices\\nThe table below outlines some of the expected costs based on hiring a plumber to unblock the toilet for you, assuming it is not an emergency call-out.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBLOCKAGE\\nMETHOD\\nCOST\\nTIME\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWithin the toilet\\nPlunger\\n£30 - £60\\n30 minutes\\n\\n\\n \\nToilet snake\\n£30 – £60\\n30 minutes\\n\\n\\nWithin the external drains\\nDrain rodding\\n£80 – £100\\nUp to 1 hour\\n\\n\\n \\nDrain jetting\\n£150 – £175\\n1 – 2 hours\\n\\n\\n \\nDrain rodding and jetting\\n£150 – £200\\n1 – 2 hours\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe following table outlines the cost of purchasing materials suitable for DIY usage, \\r\\nassuming the blockage is within the toilet or within reach of the U-bend:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMETHOD\\nMATERIAL COST\\nTIME FRAME\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlunger\\n£2 - £20\\nUp to 30 minutes\\n\\n\\nToilet unblocking chemicals\\n£5 - £30\\nAccording to instructions\\n\\n\\nToilet snake\\n£10 - £60\\nUp to 30 minutes\\n\\n\\nBaking soda and vinegar\\n£2 - £5\\n30 minutes or more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Costs\\nIf you require the assistance of a plumber to unblock your toilet, it may be worth considering if any of the \\r\\nfollowing work is also worth undertaking, especially if toilet blockages are a persistent issue:\\nNew Pipework Costs\\nIt may be that your current pipework connecting your toilet to the waste pipe is insufficient; it may be corroded, damaged or simply not large enough. \\nFor replacement piping, you can expect a cost of roughly £30 - £40.\\nNew Toilet Costs\\nIf you’re considering having work done to increase the effectiveness of your toilet, it might be worth considering replacing the toilet itself; \\r\\nespecially if you are finding blockages a recurring issue. \\nNew toilets can be purchased from between £50 - £300 and come in a variety of styles to suit every budget.\\nUpdate Bathroom Costs\\nIt stands to reason that if considerable work needs to be carried out to rectify issues within the toilet,\\r\\n that it might be worth considering updating the bathroom as a whole so that the suite matches. \\nA new bathroom suite can cost between an average of £3,000 - £6,000 depending on the style and quality of finish.\\nUnblock Sink Costs\\nA drain unblocking tool, sometimes known as a drain snake, can cost as little as £5 to purchase and is suitable for DIY use. \\nIf you are hiring a professional to unblock a toilet at a flat-rate for their first 30 minutes, it might be worth asking them to inspect \\r\\nthe sink at the same time.\\nDrain Unblocking Costs\\nIf you notice foul odours from your sinks and drains, or have frequent flushing issues within the toilets, \\r\\nit is a good indication that you have a blockage within your property drains. \\nA professional drain unblocking service will cost you around £60 for the initial call-out, plus the cost of labour to\\r\\n unblock the drains using an appropriate method such as rodding or jetting.\\n\\nCost Breakdown Calculator\\nThe average cost of unblocking a toilet, assuming a minor blockage and the use of a plunger, would be around £100.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10%\\n\\nMaterials £10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n80%\\n\\nLabour£80\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10%\\n\\nWaste Removal£10\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLabour Costs and Time Frames\\nAs a general rule, plumbers within the UK tend to charge between £150 – £200 a day for their time. \\nFor minor toilet blockages that can be easily accessed, the average time to complete the work takes roughly 30 minutes, \\r\\nat a cost of around £60 which is the average call-out charge for most UK plumbers.\\nFor more severe blockages within the internal pipework of your home or in the waste drainage pipe, \\r\\nthe time may increase to up to 2 hours and might involve drain rodding and jetting, \\r\\nwhich will incur a cost of roughly £200 for labour and materials.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nHow much does it Cost to Unblock a Toilet?\\n\\nUnblocking toilet prices\\nAdditional costs\\n\\n\\nLabour costs and time frames\\nWhat does unblocking a toilet entail?\\nCost affecting factors of fixing a blocked toilet\\nHow to unblock a toilet\\nHow to unblock a toilet with a plunger\\nWhy is my toilet blocked?\\nHow can I prevent my toilet from blocking?\\nSigns your toilet needs unblocking\\nIdentifying the blockage\\n\\nPartial blockage repair cost\\nComplete blockage repair cost\\nOutside blockage repair cost\\n\\n\\nEmergency toilet repair cost\\nCost of replacing a toilet\\nFAQs\\nHow to find and hire blocked toilet contractors\\nSources\\n\\n\\nWhat Does Unblocking a Toilet Entail?\\nThere are a number of unblocking methods can that be employed depending on the location and severity of the blockage, \\r\\neach with a different method of application. \\nThe method chosen by your plumber will be dependant on the severity of the blockage and most appropriate solution.\\nBefore any unblocking method is used, it’s recommended that you:\\n\\nCover the surrounding area with disposable materials in the event of splashing, and for ease of waste removal where necessary;\\nCheck if the obstruction can be physically removed by hand without the use of invasive tools and materials, or incurring a call-out charge;\\nWear protective, rubber gloves if completing the work yourself.\\n\\nUnblocking a Toilet Using a Plunger\\nThe majority of minor blockages can be fixed with the use of a plunger.\\n\\n\\nPlace the plunger within the toilet, ensuring it is covered by water and that a seal is formed around the draining outlet.\\nWater may need to be added to the bowl if enough is not present.\\nUsing a pumping motion, slowly push the plunger into the toilet, and quickly pull back, ensuring the seal is not broken in the process.\\nThis should be repeated roughly 20 times, or less, if you notice the water level dropping.\\nIf the blockage is still preventing water from free-flowing down the drain, refill the bowl and repeat the process.\\n\\nUnblocking a Toilet Using Hot Water\\nAdding hot (but not boiling) water to your toilet may help break up organic matter causing blockages.\\n\\nBoil a kettles’ worth of water and allow to cool slightly. \\r\\nThe temperature should be similar to a hot cup of tea that is cool enough to drink without scalding.\\nPour the water into the bowl and allow to sit.\\nYou may want to add dish-soap to help break down grease and oils that may be causing the blockage; be careful to add only a small amount though as you do not want suds to overflow.\\nYou should notice after a few minutes that the blockage has broken down and water can now pass through the toilet drain again.\\nIf hot water has not dislodged the blockage, consider using another method.\\n\\nUnblocking a Toilet Using Baking Soda\\nBaking soda and vinegar can be used in conjunction with hot water to help to remove blockages from toilets. \\nBaking soda should be added to the toilet bowl, followed by a hot (but not boiling) water and vinegar mix. \\nOnce the water has been added to the toilet, allow to sit for a minimum of 30 minutes and then flush.\\nPlumbing Snake\\nA plumbing snake (sometimes called an auger or toilet snake) is a flexible piece of wire, usually with a helix attachment for the end, \\r\\nused to physically break up and dislodge items.\\n\\n\\nThe plumbing snake will be positioned over the toilet bowl and fed down into the u-bend until contact with the blockage has been made.\\nUsing an up-and-down or twisting motion on the handle, the auger will begin to break down materials lodged within the pipework.\\nRepeat until the blockage is cleared.\\n\\nUnblocking a Toilet Using Chemical Unblocking Agents\\nChemical toilet unblockers work by reacting with the organic matter causing the blockage and breaking it down.\\n\\nAlways read the label, follow instructions carefully, and make sure to take safety precautions when handling chemicals.\\nIt’s recommended that you ventilate the room.\\nPour the recommended amount of chemical cleaner into the toilet bowl and allow to sit for the recommended time as per the manufacturer’s instructions.\\nFlush the toilet to check if the blockage has been cleared.\\n\\nCost Affecting Factors of Fixing a Blocked Toilet\\nThere are a number of factors that can affect the overall cost of unblocking a toilet, with most blockages being assessed on a case-by-case basis,\\r\\n though here are some of the more common influences on the cost:\\nType of Blockage\\nThe type of blockage within the toilet can affect the amount of time it takes to rectify, and therefore, cost of professional intervention. \\nA mild blockage will be much quicker to rectify than a complete blockage, for example.\\nA blockage caused by inorganic materials, such as a stuck toy or sanitary products, will not react to chemical cleaners, \\r\\nhot water or baking soda removal methods, and so will require alternative removal methods which may be more costly.\\nType of Treatment\\nMethods such as adding hot water and baking soda, particularly if DIY, will be considerably cheaper (costing around £5 for materials) \\r\\nthan using chemical cleaners (costing, on average, between £5 - £30), and cheaper again than enlisting the help of a professional service. \\nThough in some cases, the cost of hiring a professional is unavoidable.\\n\\nEase of Access\\nThe location of the blockage within the system will affect the cost of repair. \\nA blockage within the toilet bowl U-bend, for example, is easier to access, and therefore, assess and treat, than a blockage further down the waste pipe.\\nHow to Unblock a Toilet\\nIf you decide to DIY fix your blocked toilet, make sure to take adequate precautions for yourself and your property, \\r\\nincluding wearing suitable protective clothing such as gloves and eye-wear where appropriate. \\nRemember that you will be dealing with hazardous waste and lay disposable materials, such as newspaper, around the affected toilet to catch any spillage.\\nThere are a number of methods that can be used to unblock a toilet that are suitable for DIY undertaking. \\nThe use of plungers, hot water, baking soda and chemical cleaners are all suitable for DIY \\r\\napplication as outlined above, but will require some safety precautions, \\r\\nsuch as protective gloves, and in the case of chemical cleaners in particular, careful reading of the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\\nAs an example of cost indications, to purchase any of the below products, you can expect the following prices:\\n\\nPlunger: costs between £2 - £20 depending on the size and quality.\\nBaking soda and vinegar mix: £5 or less depending on the amount to be used.\\nChemical toilet unblockers: expect a cost in the region of £5 - £30 depending on the manufacturer.\\nToilet snake: although the cost can vary, you can expect to pay between £10 - £60 for the product, \\r\\nthough they are reusable, so it may be worth considering investing in better quality materials.\\n\\nYou should never apply excessive force to a blockage as this can cause damage to pipework; \\r\\nparticularly if you are unsure of the nature of the blockage in the first place. \\nIf the blockage is not easy to remove, it may be an indication that there is damage to the pipework and you will need to hire a \\r\\nprofessional to assess the situation, as there may be more issues than originally thought which may require additional work, \\r\\nsuch as drain jetting, fixing or replacing broken pipes,\\r\\nor having your septic tank emptied.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReady to get a quote from local tradesmen?\\nPost your job in minutes and get quotes from local and reliable trades.

No obligations.\\nGet a Quote \\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Unblock a Toilet with a Plunger\\nPlungers are usually the go-to method of blockage removal within toilets as they are easy to use and cheap to purchase, \\r\\ncosting as little as £2 from some retail stores, to upwards of £20, \\r\\ndepending on the materials and quality of the product.\\nAs with any waste disposal, you will want to make sure you have adequate protection for yourself and your property, \\r\\nso ensure you wear rubber gloves (costing around £1 - £10 a pair) and some sort of disposable material, \\r\\nsuch as newspaper, to cover the floor to protect against splashing and spillage. \\nIt’s also advisable to have a bucket or container to hand in case water needs to be removed from the toilet bowl.\\nWhen choosing your plunger you should consider the size of the waste outlet that you are tackling; the plunger needs\\r\\n to be large enough that it can seal around the waste pipe with no gaps. \\n\\nThis is important as plunging relies on pressure being forced down the pipes and an incomplete seal will render the plunger useless.\\nOnce the correct size plunger has been selected, place inside the toilet bowl to form a seal over the waste outlet. \\nDepending on the blockage you may need to add more water to the bowl to ensure the plunger head is covered.\\nSlowly push the plunger down; this will gently force the air and water against the blockage and pull back sharply, careful not to break the seal. \\nRepeat the process until the blockage has been cleared.\\nYou can test whether the blockage has been dislodged by flushing the toilet. If it hasn’t, you can repeat the process, removing excess water if needed. \\nIf plunging is unsuccessful after repeated attempts, you may need to try another method or call a professional.\\nWhy Is My Toilet Blocked?\\nToilet blockages can be caused by a number of things, but the most common causes are outlined below:\\nFlushing Too Much Toilet Paper At One Time\\nToilet paper is absorbent and so expands slightly on contact with water. \\nAs waste outlets are not particularly big, toilet paper can become lodged, restricting the flow of waste materials.\\nFlushing Inappropriate Materials\\nToilets and sewer systems are not designed to handle certain items, such as wet wipes and sanitary products, \\r\\nwhich are not biodegradable and can cause severe blockages within pipework if they become stuck. \\nIt’s recommended that these products are disposed of in waste bins. \\nFailure to do so could see you with a hefty bill to repair damages that could otherwise be avoided.\\nBuilt-up Materials in the Waste Pipe\\nBuilt-up materials, such as grease and limescale, can cause drainage issues within your home and should be addressed as soon as the problem appears. \\nIt’s recommended that you clean your home pipework, including the toilet, at least once a week using appropriate cleaning solutions to minimise\\r\\n the risk of causing a blockage.\\nDeodorising or Cleaning Blocks Becoming Lodged\\nCleaning blocks placed within the toilet may seem like a good idea as they will refresh the bowl whenever the toilet is flushed, \\r\\nbut they run the risk of becoming loose and travelling down your waste outlet. \\nThey may even become lodged between the cistern and the toilet bowl. \\n\\nIf you use these products, ensure they are properly secured to minimise the risk of causing a blockage.\\nCesspit or Septic Tank may be Full\\nIf you own a septic tank or cesspit and you find that your toilet is not flushing, it may be worth investigating to see whether \\r\\nit needs to be emptied. \\nOnce the cesspit is full, there will be no room for the waste materials to go to so you could find that materials \\r\\nare backing-up into the pipework and stopping your toilet from flushing.\\nChildren’s Toys\\nIf you have small children in your home you may find that, occasionally, one of their toys finds its way into the toilet and, \\r\\npotentially, gets stuck if the toilet has been flushed. \\nIf you can see the toy you may be able to grab hold of it, but otherwise you will likely need a plunger to rescue it. \\nWhere possible, try to keep the toilet lid closed to prevent items accidently dropping into the toilet pan.\\nConstruction Waste\\nConstruction materials, such as mortar, glues and fillers, should never be flushed down the toilet or drains, \\r\\nas they will cause difficult-to-remove blockages if they set. \\nThese items should be disposed of safely in a bin.\\nHow Can I Prevent My Toilet From Blocking?\\nThe best way to prevent toilet blockages is to be careful about what is placed in them in the first place.\\nItems such as sanitary products, wet-wipes and nappies, should be placed within bins and not flushed into the toilet system,\\r\\n preferably even when the packaging suggests they are biodegradable.\\nThey can take longer to disintegrate than you might think which can cause blockages in the meantime.\\nYou should regularly clean your toilet to help prevent limescale and debris build-up, including under the rim where water\\r\\n flows from using a toilet brush and suitable cleaning chemicals.\\n\\nReusable toilet brushes can be purchased for around £2-£15\\nA toilet brush with replaceable brush-heads for can be bought for roughly £5, plus £5 - £10 per \\r\\npack of replacement brush heads.\\n\\nYou should only flush as much toilet paper as necessary at any one time; trying to dispose of large amounts of toilet\\r\\n paper at one time can cause blockages.\\nSigns Your Toilet Needs Unblocking\\nThere are a number of signs that may indicate that your toilet is blocked and that action needs to be taken in order to fix the issue.\\nSlow to Flush\\nIf your toilet takes longer than expected to release water from the cistern into the bowl during a flush, \\r\\nit could be an indication that the water-level within the tank is not adequate, or that there is a blockage between the tank and the toilet bowl. \\nThis can be caused by the tank ball creating a seal over the outlet, or a build-up of materials over the rinse outlets.\\nSlow to Drain\\nIf you notice your toilet is taking longer than usual to drain after flushing, it can indicate the presence of a partial blockage \\r\\nwhich can be caused by either waste materials or a build-up of calcium and minerals within the pipeline.\\nOverflowing\\nOverflowing is an obvious indicator that a blockage is present within your toilet system. \\n\\nThe blockage may not be complete and the water level may drop slowly over time, or may not unblock at all without intervention.\\nToilet Gurgles Whilst Draining\\nGurgling in a drain or toilet whilst it is emptying indicates a partial blockage. \\nWaste is still moving through the system, but not at the rate it should be, and the gurgling is caused by air pockets being \\r\\ndisturbed and distributed back through the toilet system as waste passes the blockage.\\nThe Toilet Bowl Remains Empty after Flushing\\nIf the bowl fails to refill after flushing the toilet, it could be an indication that there is trapped air within the waste pipes. \\nYou may have noticed gurgling prior to this issue.\\nIdentifying the Blockage\\nThere are several types of blockage, and knowing which sort you are facing can help you to decide the best method to use for fixing the issue.\\nPartial Blockage Repair Cost\\nA partial blockage is generally characterised by slow drainage from the bowl into the drains. \\nYou may notice some gurgling and spluttering as well whilst the materials are moving down the waste line, \\r\\ncaused by trapped air being forced back up through the pipes.\\nA partial blockage can be rectified using most unblocking methods, though it’s recommended that you use the least\\r\\n invasive unblocking methods to minimise the risk of accidental damage to the toilet and drains. \\nThe most commonly used methods to dislodge partial blockages are toilet unblocking chemicals that break up the clog or the\\r\\n use of a plunger to dislodge the blockage.\\nA plumber will likely charge between £30 - £60 to fix a partial blockage, \\r\\nbudgeting for 30 minutes of their time. \\nAlthough these are relatively cheap and easy for you to rectify yourself, with the material needed costing as little as £2 - £30.\\nComplete Blockage Repair Cost\\nA complete blockage will become apparent when either the toilet bowl does not empty at all after flushing, or the toilet fails to refill after flushing. \\nIf you suspect you know the cause of the blockage, and the location of the blockage is accessible from the toilet bowl, \\r\\nthere are a few methods that can be used to dislodge it.\\nFor this type of blockage, professionals would recommend using a plunger or toilet auger to breakup or dislodge the blockage. \\nDepending on the severity of the blockage, this process could take up to an hour to complete and would cost in the \\r\\nregion of £60 – £120 to fix.\\nOutside Blockage Repair Cost\\nSometimes the blockage is not within the toilet, but within the drainage pipes themselves, \\r\\nwhich can be very costly to rectify if the issue isn’t addressed immediately. \\nPressure behind the blockage can cause pipes to collapse and can force waste materials back up into your home.\\nSigns that you have an external blockage can include the toilet not flushing, external drains overflowing or noticing a \\r\\nfoul smell coming from your sinks or washing machine.\\nIn the event that your drains need unblocking, you will likely require a type of professional \\r\\nrodding or jetting service to unblock the system,\\r\\nwhich will usually cost around between £100 - £200 and can take up to 2 hours to completely remove a large blockage.\\nIt’s important to hire a drain specialist if you think your external drains are blocked, \\r\\nas they will be trained to identify the nature of the blockage and take the most appropriate course of action to rectify the issue. \\nDrain specialists typically cost more to hire than a standard plumber, but they are better trained and equipped to deal with external drainage issues, \\r\\nand in particular, those related to sewerage issues.\\nWhilst it may be tempting to save some money and use a pressure washer yourself to dislodge a blockage, professionals do not recommend it. \\nPressure washers can be dangerous to use and can cause damage to the pipelines if mishandled, particularly if the wrong pressure is used. \\nAdditionally, the issue may not be a build up of materials causing the blockage, but a collapsed pipe instead – in which case, \\r\\npressure washing the line will just cause further damage.\\nEmergency Toilet Repair Cost\\nYou should take action as soon as you begin to notice issues within your toilet system. \\nA blocked toilet is likely to worsen over time if left unattended and you may be left with no choice but to hire an emergency plumbing\\r\\n service if the issue is left unresolved.\\nIf you notice leaking around your toilet, or if your drains begin overflowing, you should seek professional services immediately to \\r\\nreduce the risk of further damage to your property.\\n\\nIf your property only has one WC it can be incredibly inconvenient if your toilet suddenly ceases to function and you may need to hire \\r\\nan emergency plumber to fix the issue as soon as possible. \\nIf you have tried to unblock the toilet yourself with no success, \\r\\nit is also an indication that the issue is further down the line than is accessible and that a plumber will need to be contacted to complete the work.\\nTypically speaking, emergency plumbing services are charged at two to three times the standard call-out rate, starting at roughly £180. \\nSo it’s recommended that if you suspect you have an issue with a blocked toilet and you cannot fix it yourself, \\r\\nto hire a plumber as soon as possible to fix the issue, to avoid the extra cost.\\nFailing to hire an emergency plumber when needed could see you with a costly bill to rectify any damage caused by the broken plumbing; \\r\\nfrom replacing burst pipes, to re-plastering, to\\r\\n redecorating affected areas.\\nCost of Replacing a Toilet\\nIf you find yourself regularly faced with a blocked toilet issue, or that your toilet itself is aged and beginning to show wear, \\r\\nor even if the flushing mechanism is becoming inefficient, you may want to weigh up the maintenance costs you face against the cost\\r\\n of having a new toilet installed.\\nToilet replacements come in a variety of styles to suit every budget, with costs ranging from as little as £50 to purchase, \\r\\nto upwards of £300 depending on the style and model. \\n\\nThe cost will also be affected depending on if you choose a standing WC, or a wall-hung WC and whether you are replacing the cistern as well.\\nInstallation costs will vary depending on your needs, but assuming that blockages are the main cause of replacement, you can expect a \\r\\ncost of between £300 - £800 to replace the toilet and connecting pipework, including labour, averaging at 2 – 6 hours \\r\\ndepending on the complexity of the work involved.\\nFAQs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                                           How to unblock a toilet without plunger?\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                                      There are a number of DIY methods that can be used to unblock a toilet even without a plunger, including: toilet unblocking chemicals; adding hot (but not boiling) water to the toilet bowl; using a baking soda and vinegar mix to break down organic material; using a toilet snake to break up the blockage.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMake sure that you wear protective gloves when attempting to unblock a toilet yourself and to place disposable\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tmaterials on the floor of the surrounding area for an easier clean-up afterwards.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                                          How to remove limescale from toilet U-bend?\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                                     The most effective way to remove built-up limescale from a U-bend is to add toilet cleaning chemicals to the \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t toilet that will break down the deposits. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Some people also recommend pouring white vinegar (also called spirit vinegar) down the toilet and allowing to sit\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t overnight before scrubbing with a brush as an organic means of descaling the system. \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                                         Do cistern blocks cause damage?\\r\\n                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCistern blocks don’t necessarily cause damage to a toilet, but they can cause it to operate less efficiently.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOnce worn down through use, cistern blocks can become stuck between the cistern and the toilet giving you an insufficient flush, but due to their nature, they will dissolve over time and will not cause damage to your toilet system.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilarly, if the cistern block is overlapping the seal between the cistern and toilet, you may find that you experience leaking.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIf you are concerned about the potential negative effects of cistern blocks, there are many alternatives available on the market that can be placed within the toilet bowl (either stuck on or hung over the rim) that will have a similar affect.\\r\\n                                                            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                                          Do I need to call a plumber to fix my blocked toilet?\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                                                       Not necessarily.

It's something that needs to be fixed quickly. Here we discuss the costs.\\nLet's get started...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage Cost of Unblocking a Toilet:\\nDepending on the complexity of the job, it usually takes:\\n\\n£45\\n\\n \\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n How Much Does It Cost to Unblock a Toilet?\\n Unblocking Toilet Prices\\n\\n\\n Supply Only Costs\\n Additional Costs\\n Labour Costs and Timescales\\n Cost Factors of Unblocking a Toilet\\n What's Involved in Unblocking a Toilet?\\n Can I Unblock a Toilet Myself?\\n Building Regulations & Planning Permission for Unblocking a Toilet \\n Hiring Contractors to Unblock a Toilet Checklist\\n FAQs\\n Sources\\n\\n\\nHow Much Does It Cost to Unblock a Toilet?\\nIf you're wondering how much it costs to unblock a toilet, this article will tell you everything you need to know.\\nThis includes unblocking a toilet prices, the timescales you can expect, and some things that you should look out for when finding the right contractor for the job.\\nUnblocking Toilet Prices\\nBelow is a table highlighting the costs that you can expect when it comes to unclogging a toilet:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJob Description\\nAverage Cost\\nDuration\\n\\n\\nFix blockage within the toilet using a plunger\\n£30-£60\\n30 minutes\\n\\n\\nFix blockage within the toilet using a toilet snake\\n£30-£60\\n30 minutes\\n\\n\\nFix blockage in external drains via drain rodding\\n£80-£100\\nUp to an hour\\n\\n\\nFix blockage in external drains via drain jetting\\n£150-£175\\n1-2 hours\\n\\n\\nFix blockage in external drains via drain rodding and jetting\\n£150-£200\\n1-2 hours\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant a custom price?\\nPost your job\\n\\n\\n\\nSo how much does unblocking a toilet cost? A plumber will typically charge an initial call-out fee to come and assess the issue. Then, assuming the blockage is minor and not hidden in the pipework, unblocking can take as little as 30 minutes and will usually come at a price of around £30-£60. However, this may cost a little bit more if you live in the London area.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome more complicated or severe blockages will take longer to fix and will cost more. You could pay up to around £100-£200 for more severe blockages depending on the problem and how long it takes for the plumber to fix it.\\nSupply Only Costs\\nIf you think the blockage is quite small and within the toilet itself and not the pipework, then you may be tempted to try to unblock it yourself as a DIY job. If so, you will need some materials to complete the job.\\nBelow is a list of some of the supplies that you may need to purchase to help you unblock the toilet, along with how much you can expect to pay for each item:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaterial\\nAverage  Cost\\n\\n\\nPlunger \\n£2-£20\\n\\n\\nToilet unblocking chemicals\\n£5-£30\\n\\n\\nToilet snake\\n£10-£60\\n\\n\\nBaking soda and vinegar\\n£2-£5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant a custom price?\\nPost your job\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind Tradespeople, compare up to 3 quotes!\\nIt's FREE and there are no obligations\\n\\n\\nGet started\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Costs\\nThere are several additional costs that you may need to think about with this type of work. Below is a list of the main additional costs that may come up when you have your toilet unlocked:\\nNew Pipework\\nIf the current pipework that connects to your toilet is insufficient or faulty, then it may need to be replaced. It could be that it is damaged or corroded and you can't see it. If this is the case, you can expect to pay around £30-£40 for new pipework to be installed.\\nReplacement Toilet\\nIf your toilet is prone to blockages or quite old, then it may be a good idea to think about replacing your old toilet with a new one now. The average cost to have a new toilet installed is around £300-£600.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, you can usually find a wide range of different toilets to suit any budget, so you may find a cheaper deal if you shop around.\\nNew Bathroom Installation\\nIf you are thinking about getting a new toilet installed, you may even want to consider getting a whole new bathroom with matching components.\\nThe cost for a new bathroom will vary depending on the size of the bathroom and the quality of the materials used. However, the average cost for a new bathroom in the UK is around £5000-£10,000. \\nDrain Unblocking\\nIf you start to notice foul odours coming from your drains or your sink, then you may have a blockage in your drains. A professional drain unblocking service will usually cost around £80-£150 depending on the issue and the method used to unblock it.\\nLabour Costs and Timescales\\nWhen you have a blocked toilet, it is best to call a professional plumber to come and complete the work of unblocking it. As a general rule, plumbers tend to charge a daily rate of around £150-£200. \\nWhen it comes to minor toilet unblocking or small toilet repairs, these can usually be completed within 30 minutes and will usually cost around £60. This is the average call-out price for most plumbers in the UK.\\nIf the blockage is more severe or extends out into the pipework, then the time it takes to unblock it may increase up to around two hours. More extensive unblocking jobs could cost up to around £200 on average.\\n\\n\\nAsk a Trade\\nGot a question that only a tradesperson can answer? We have thousands of trades ready to answer any question you may have.\\nAsk your question\\n\\n\\n\\nCost Factors of Unblocking a Toilet\\nThere are several factors that may affect the cost of unblocking a toilet. Below is a list of the main things that could have an impact on the overall cost of the job:\\nType of Blockage\\nMany things can cause a blockage within your toilet, and some are easier to fix than others. A mild blockage can take as little as 30 minutes to unblock, but a more severe blockage such as a blocked toilet drain or a blockage within the pipework could take a few hours. The longer the plumber needs to spend at your property, the more you should expect to pay for the work.\\nEase of Access\\nThe location of the blockage can affect the overall cost of the job. A blockage within the toilet bowl U-bend is much easier to access than a blockage that is further down the waste pipe. The more difficult the blockage is to get to, the longer it will take to unblock and will end up costing more.\\nLocation of Property\\nYour location within the UK can have quite a substantial effect on how much you will pay to have your toilet unblocked. Plumbers in the London area can charge around £30-£100 more per day than plumbers based in other parts of the UK. So, if you are based in London, you can expect to pay more to get your toilet unblocked than someone who lives in another part of the UK.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat's Involved in Unblocking a Toilet?\\nThere are several methods that can be used to unblock the toilet. The method used will depend on the type of blockage and the location of the blockage. Below is an overview of the main types of drain unblocking techniques:\\nUnblocking with Plunger\\nMost minor blockages can be resolved using a plunger. Take the steps below to unblock your toilet with a plunger:\\n\\nPlace the plunger in the toilet and ensure the water covers it and that a seal is formed around the draining outlet.\\nWater may need to be added to the bowl if there is not enough in there.\\nUse a pumping motion by slowly pushing the plunger into the toilet and then quickly pulling it back, ensuring that the seal isn't broken.\\nRepeat this step around 20 times or less if you notice that the water level is dropping.\\nIf the blockage is still present, refill the bowl and repeat the process.\\n\\nUnlock with Toilet Snake\\nA plumbing snake is a flexible piece of wire with a helix-style attachment on the end. This is used to break up and dislodge items that are blocking the toilet. Take the steps below to unblock your toilet with a toilet snake:\\nPosition the toilet snake over the toilet bowl and then feed it down into the U-bend until you make contact with the blockage.\\nUse an up and down or twisting motion on the handle to begin the process of breaking up the blockage.\\nRepeat this process until the blockage is cleared.\\n\\nUnblock with Chemical Agents\\nChemical toilet unblocking agents work by reacting with the blockage materials to break them down. Take the steps below to unblock your toilet with a chemical unblocking agent:\\n\\nStart by reading the label as each unblocking agent is different and may require a different method.\\nTake the appropriate safety precautions as described on the label.\\nVentilate the room by opening the windows.\\nPour the recommended amount of agent down the toilet bowl and allow it to sit there for the recommended time according to the label.\\nFlush the toilet to check that the blockage has been cleared.\\n\\nCan I Unblock a Toilet Myself?\\nIn most cases, it is possible to unblock a toilet yourself, providing you have the appropriate tools needed to do so. The methods above are quite simple and can be completed as a DIY task. Most of the time, the above methods will work for fixing minor blockages.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, if the blockage is within the pipework, you will most likely need to hire a plumber to complete this work for you. Blockages in the external pipework and drainage systems can be quite difficult to reach and will require specialist equipment to complete the unblocking.\\nBuilding Regulations & Planning Permission for Unblocking a Toilet \\nWhen it comes to unblocking a toilet, you won't need to worry about building regulations or planning permission. \\nHiring Contractors to Unblock a Toilet Checklist\\nYou will need to consider a few things before hiring contractors to unblock a toilet for you. Below is a list of some of the main things that you should consider when looking for the right contractors for the job:\\n\\nDoes the contractor offer any guarantees with their work?\\nHow much is the work to complete? – Ask for a breakdown of costs so you can ensure you are paying a good price for each element of the job.\\nIs the contractor experienced in unblocking toilets -specifically with the type of blockage that you have?\\nHow many years' worth of experience does the contractor have in unblocking toilets?\\nHow many contractors will carry out the job?\\nWill the contractor fix any issues that may arise?\\nWill the contractor take care of any relevant waste removal?\\nDo you need to hire any additional contractors for different parts of the work?\\nWhich method of unblocking will the contractor use?\\nDo you need to provide any materials to assist with the unblocking?\\n\\nFAQs\\n\\n\\nWhat's the best way to clean a toilet?\\n\\nThere are many different methods for cleaning a toilet. Below is a step-by-step guide on the best way to clean your toilet:\\r\\n\\nStart with the outside of the toilet itself. Work your way up from the foundation to the lid by spraying the underneath thoroughly with a disinfectant spray. Spray all areas of the toilet, including the small area between the seat and the tank, and also spray the tank itself.\\nNext, spray down both sides of the lid with a decent amount of disinfectant.\\nThen, spray both sides of the toilet seat and lower it back onto the bowl once it's been thoroughly sprayed.\\nWhile you're waiting for the disinfectant to dry, you can move on to cleaning some of the tougher points that are more prone to germs. Clean the toilet flush handle, especially as this can be one of the dirtiest parts of a toilet and is prone to many germs. Do this with a sponge or cloth and some disinfectant.\\nOnce the disinfectant is mostly dry, give your entire toilet a wipe using a sponge or a cloth.\\nClean the inside of the toilet bowl using some toilet cleaner and a toilet brush.\\nAlways finish your cleaning session with a flush.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the main cause of a blocked toilet?\\n\\nThe main cause of a blocked toilet is usually too much toilet paper being pushed down in a single flush. This can cause a build-up in the system and can result in blocking. \\n\\n\\nDo cistern blocks cause damage to my toilet?\\n\\nCistern blocks don't tend to cause any damage to your toilet. However, they can make them operate less effectively. Once they start to wear down, the blocks can become stuck in the space between the cistern and the toilet, resulting in insufficient flushes. Due to their nature, they will dissolve over time and won't cause any damage to the toilet system.\\n\\n\\nDo I need to call out a plumber to fix my blocked toilet?\\n\\nYou won't necessarily need to call out a plumber to fix your clogged toilet. It will depend on the type of blockage and the severity of the blockage. We have provided you with some methods of unblocking the toilet yourself within this article. If these methods fail, it is best to call a plumber to avoid any damage caused to the system. \\r\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the best way to remove a toilet seat?\\n\\nYour toilet seat will most likely be attached with screws or bolts that are hidden by two caps. Remove the caps using a flat head screwdriver and then unscrew the fixings underneath. Your toilet seat should now lift away easily. \\n\\n\\nSources\\n\\nhttps://www.realhomes.com/advice/how-to-unblock-a-toilet\\nhttps://www.plumbjet.com/what-are-the-causes-of-blocked-toilets-and-how-do-i-clear-them\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind Tradespeople, compare up to 3 quotes!\\nIt's FREE and there are no obligations\\nPost a job\\n\\n \\nRelated articles\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRadiator Replacement Cost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTap Replacement Cost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCost Of Gas Installation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmergency Plumber Cost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAir Source Heat Pump Cost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkirting Board Heating Cost\\n\\n\\nSee all articles\\n\\nAsk a Trade\\nGot a question that only a tradesperson can answer?

Written by Fixr.com.\\n\\n\\nConsidering the average person makes around 2,500 trips to the toilet each year, things are expected to go wrong. The more people using the same toilet, the more likely issues are to occur. While toilets are meant to last for decades with little maintenance or fuss, that does not mean they do not have an occasional clog that needs to be resolved. If you have frequent clogs or an incidental backup, it might be time to hire a professional to resolve the problem before it creates a plumbing nightmare.The national average cost to unclog a toilet is $200 to $700, with most people spending about $350 for a plumber to use an electric auger to clear the toilet drain clog and test the system. This project’s low cost is $100 for a simple drain snaking or professional chemical treatment by a plumber. The high cost is $1,000 for hydro jetting serious clogs that have been left unattended and caused sewer backup or pipes that need repair of the toilet drain.Cost to Unclog ToiletUnclog Toilet CostNational average cost$350Average range$200-$700Low-end$100High-end$1,000Cost to Unclog a Toilet by MethodThe average cost to unclog a toilet is $50 to $1,500, depending on the type of materials or unclogging method and the labor, time, and equipment. There are several methods for unclogging a toilet. The one your plumber uses depends on clog type and how severe it is. Below are the average costs of each method of unclogging a toilet, what each method entails, and why it might be used.Unclogging MethodAverage CostReplacement$50 - $1,500Snake$100 - $250Rodding$150 - $400Removing Toilet$200 - $550Hydro Jetting Pipes$250 - $800Electric Snake$300 - $400Open Pipe Cleaning$600 - $700ReplacementSometimes, the best way to unclog a toilet is by replacing a specific part. If the clog is impossible to remove or there is other damage to a specific component, replacing it might be the plumber’s recommendation. The price to replace toilet components ranges from $50 to $1,500, depending on the part and amount of labor needed. Some of the most common items replaced are listed below, along with their associated costs.Expect to spend $700 to $1,500 to replace the toilet drain pipe. Replacing a sewage line due to roots or clogs is more expensive at $700 to $1,000. If small parts like the float rod and ball or chain need to be replaced, the cost ranges between $50 and $250. Valve replacement also may be needed and is usually a single service that replaces the handle, flush valve, tank bolds, and flapper for $250 to $300. Tank replacement or bowl replacement can also be done for $250 to $500.Snake a ToiletThe average cost to snake a toilet with a standard snake is about $100 to $250. If a clog is minor, a hand-operated snake can remove the small or medium-sized blockage. A small auger is attached to the end of the snake used to help clear the debris. However, this is not a permanent solution because it does not remove the debris on the sides of the pipes. However, it can be a short-term solution or provide a one-time fix for an incidental clog.Rodding Clogged ToiletThe price to rod a toilet ranges from $150 to $400 and is most commonly used with larger clogs. It can also be used on pipes of all sizes and has enough strength to handle tree roots. With rodding, several flexible rods of varying sizes are pushed through the pipe to break and move clogs so that the water can move how it should. For large pipes, rodding is recommended because it clears more area in a short time with large rods. While the rods are flexible, they are also strong and durable, making them ideal for breaking roots.Removing a Toilet to UnclogTaking a toilet apart takes time. Most plumbing professionals charge about $200 to $550 for this job. Anything that takes more time to complete the project raises costs. Like accessing the pipe, there may be instances where a clog requires removing the toilet. The professional removes the entire toilet, clears the clog, and replaces the toilet. This often happens when there is a foreign object at the toilet base or where it flows into the drain. These clogs can often be removed by hand, or a snake or auger can be used. This type of clog removal costs more because of removing the toilet, but it may be the best option in some cases.Hydro Jetting PipesFor those with a more serious cleaning need, the average hydro jetting pipes cost is $250 to $800. Hydro jetting allows you to remove leftover sewage, hair, grease, soap, and other things that build up in the drains. This solution involves high-pressure water, so it might not be ideal for all clogs or older pipes that could crumble under stress. Special nozzles are used to push buildup from the pipe to remove the clog. Nozzles come in different styles, including chain flail, penetrators, and spinning rotary. The plumber can decide if this is an effective solution for your clog.Electric Snake Clogged ToiletThe average cost to use an electric snake to unclog a toilet is $300 to $400, depending on the type and size of snake needed for the job and how long it takes. It may be used for severe clogs that cannot be resolved with a simpler snaking solution or treatment option. This is a service best handled by professionals who understand how to use the tool because the wrong size electric snake can cause damage or be unable to handle the clog.Open Pipe CleaningIn some cases, opening the pipe to clear a complete blockage may be required, costing about $600 to $700. Clearing a blocked toilet waste pipe may involve using a camera to identify the blockage, removing foreign objects or buildup, or another removal. The pipe is usually opened at the seam closest to the clog. It is messier and requires more effort, but it might be the only choice in some cases. Talk to your plumber and get an accurate diagnosis so that you do not do more work than necessary.\\n\\nHire a local plumber to unclog a toilet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind Pros\\n\\n\\nInvalid zip code\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage Cost to Unclog a Toilet by Clog LocationThe average cost to unclog a toilet based on the clog’s location is between $100 and $700. This price varies depending on the clog location because of accessibility and the parts or tools required to perform clog removals. Plumbers can better advise once they see what is going on, but this information gives you a general idea of what to expect. The table and subsections below discuss the most common clog locations, how much it costs to fix each, and what they entail.Clog LocationCost to UnclogShut-Off Valve$100 - $200Tank$100 - $250Trap$100 - $250Bowl$100 - $300Air Vents$100 - $300Drain$100 - $400Toilet and Sink$200 - $500Drain Line$200 - $700Main Sewer Line$350 - $650Toilet Shut-Off Valve CloggedIf the toilet shut-off valve is clogged, dealing with the issue costs between $100 and $200. While this is a less common issue, minerals and debris may get in the valve. The primary way to handle this issue is removing the valve, cleaning it using a snake or auger, and reinstalling it to the toilet. However, a new one can be installed more quickly in many cases. If you have an issue with a clogged shut-off valve, it most often leads to a toilet filled with water but much more slowly than usual.Clogged Toilet TankA plumber can fix a clogged toilet tank for $100 to $250. A clog may prevent the toilet tank from filling with water. This may make it impossible to flush because water cannot be transferred to the toilet bowl. In most cases, removing the clog can be done using a simple snake (with or without a camera) or an auger. Sometimes, the tank must be removed and replaced if the problem is severe.Clogged Toilet TrapIf you have a blocked toilet trap, expect to spend $100 to $250 to remove the clog without removing the toilet. The trap is the curved section between the tank and toilet bowl. It can often become clogged with debris and other buildups because of its curved shape. If this trap gets clogged, the gasses and water cannot move like they should, causing the toilet to malfunction or risk releasing dangerous sewer gasses. A snake or auger can remove the clog.Unclog a Toilet BowlThe average cost to unclog a toilet bowl is about $100 to $300, provided the clog is contained in the bowl and does not require additional drain clearing. In some cases, the toilet bowl becomes clogged with feces, toilet paper, or foreign objects that fall or are dropped in the toilet. The flushing mechanism can malfunction and lead to clogs or backups because the toilet cannot flush properly. Resolving the issue means removing the clog with a plumbing snake and ensuring proper flushing and filling of the bowl once the clog has been removed.Toilet Air VentsIf the clog is related to a backup in the plumbing vents, you could spend about $100 to $300 to clear the toilet air vents in your bathroom. The vent stacks can become filled with debris or even snow that builds up due to damaged flashing . When the vents are damaged or clogged, they can prevent proper flushing and drainage of the toilet and other plumbing systems. Plus, they may also cause the backup of dangerous gasses, which can be harmful to the air quality in your home. Ensure your vents are in good shape at all times. A plumber’s snake or auger can clear the air vents.Unclog a Toilet DrainA clogged toilet drain, which costs an average of $100 to $400, is seen often and is a fairly easy repair. Several basic clogs can happen, including this one, and clearing is usually best done with a basic snake or auger. Some plumbers use a hydro jet machine for more serious clogs, but minor issues are usually handled with a snake. The clog severity determines its cost. This is different from the toilet drain line, which is the main drain line feeding into the sewer main lower down in the plumbing.Toilet and Sink CloggedWhen the toilet and sink are clogged, expect to pay $200 to $500 to remove the clog(s). This situation can occur when there is a serious clog in the main drain line where the sink and toilet lead. It may also result from shared drain lines between the two that could lead to issues. This often happens in older houses with plumbing that is not to code. When the toilet and sink are clogged, the plumber addresses them separately and ensures the entire system works together. Drains and augers are the most common ways to handle this issue.Unclog Toilet Drain LineThe average cost to unclog a toilet drain line, the major drain line running from the toilet to the main sewer line, is $200 to $700. This service is often needed when the clog is farther down in the drain due to a blockage or backup rather than a foreign object. However, smaller objects may also get trapped and require a more serious removal. Unblocking the drain line is usually best done with hydro jetting, but snaking can be an option for some jobs. The type of clearing method and the clog severity determine the cost.Unclog Main Sewer LineIf severe issues have persisted and made their way into the main sewer line, expect to spend an average of $350 to $650 for a camera inspection and full clearing of the main sewer line when a severe clog is present. Plumbers may need to locate the clog and remove the pipes to fix them when they are damaged. In some cases, houses have old clay tiles in the sewer main, meaning a full replacement could be costly. Serious jobs and full-line replacements could cost several thousand dollars more if left unresolved.Plumber Cost to Unclog a ToiletThe average labor cost for unclogging a toilet is $75 to $150 per hour for a professional plumber to do the work. Other factors impacting the price are your location, the plumber, their experience, and whether they are a private contractor or corporate plumbing franchise. For the average situation, this costs $100 to $275. Plumbers are trained to handle all types of issues. They have the correct tools for the job so that you know things are done correctly. In most cases, unclogging a toilet costs a flat fee. However, some plumbers have an hourly cost, especially for more challenging clogs. If more than one service is needed, a per-project cost may be chosen but is rarer.If the plumber decides the toilet must be replaced to prevent clogs, expect to pay about $425 to $900 for the toilet and installation costs. Costs to unclog or replace a toilet vary based on the clog severity and the problem causing the clog. To figure out how much you spend on labor, you can assume the average toilet repair for a small-to-average clog takes two to three hours to complete. Larger jobs could take days and the assistance of additional professionals, each having labor costs to consider.Camera Inspection of a ToiletIn some cases, the plumber might use a camera snake to look in the drain and locate or identify the clog before they do the work. The average cost to inspect your toilet with a toilet inspection camera ranges from $250 to $450, depending on how much of the toilet and drain needs to be inspected and what camera is used. If the entire sewer line system needs to be inspected, the cost could be as much as $750 to $1,500.These cameras provide high-resolution images of what is inside the drain to determine the appropriate solution. The service is usually included with snaking and clearing the drain when performed but has its own charge. Cameras are used when a plumber needs a better idea of the root cause of the clog to determine the best method to move forward with.Inspecting a pipe or sewer line indicates where the clog is located and what is causing it. For example, if there are tree roots in a line, the pipe may need to be removed so that the roots can be dug up before a new pipe is installed. Identifying and handling the issue could take as little as an hour or several days if the issue is serious, such as digging up a sewer line.\\n\\nCompare prices from top-rated plumbers to unclog a toilet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare Quotes\\n\\n\\nInvalid zip code\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRoto-Rooter Cost to Unclog ToiletRoto-Rooter is one of the biggest franchise companies. They charge an average of $200 to $450 to unclog a toilet or branch line in the plumbing system, with flat rates instead of hourly labor rates. This company is on the higher end of the price range for most jobs, but they have a professional reputation that many people appreciate. Get a detailed estimate for your exact clog issues before agreeing to work because a cheaper service may be available.Roto-Rooter also has a machine that is a popular method used to unclog toilets. The Roto-Rooter is a large machine made to cut through roots. It can be used on various pipes but is most common on sewer pipes. It is moved as close as possible to the pipe before the sewer trap is opened by a professional, and an auger is inserted. Its rotating head is pushed into the line, and the cutting mechanism breaks through anything in the way, including small and medium-sized tree roots. The cost for hydro jetting a drain with a Roto-Rooter ranges from $500 to $900 for a sewer main pipe. Prices depend on the clog severity and location.Average Cost of an Emergency Toilet UnclogIn some cases, a toilet unclog could be considered an emergency. An emergency toilet unclog is where you call and have someone come out immediately rather than waiting for an opening in the plumber’s schedule. If you have a single toilet and it is clogged and overflows, an emergency plumber can help. The same applies if you cannot turn off the water main because more water could drain on the floor and cause damage. It may be okay for those with multiple toilets to wait to get service the following day. However, make sure you clean the overflowed water from the toilet because it could damage the bathroom. If the toilet is clogged but not overflowing, using another toilet and calling the plumber the next day is also reasonable.In many cases, evening and weekend work is also considered an emergency. The rate per hour for an emergency is often higher, at $150 to $200, and a flat fee of $200 to $300 may also be required. A transportation fee is sometimes added, ranging from $50 to $200. This can lead to a total price of $400 to $700 for emergency visits.What Causes a Toilet to Clog?Toilet clogs can be caused by something simple like using too much of the wrong toilet paper or something more serious like your main sewer line becoming damaged or infiltrated. In most cases, the reason your toilet is clogged is the result of someone flushing something they should not. Small children are infamous for flushing toys and other materials down the toilet. However, they are not the only ones in the house to blame. Adults sometimes flush things they should not, such as feminine hygiene products, tissues, and wrappers. There are also things like toothpaste caps, hair accessories, and cotton swabs that accidentally fall into the toilet and get flushed. Even too much toilet paper or fecal matter can clog a toilet. An inefficient low-flow toilet is also more likely to have clogs.Hard water can be the cause of some toilet backups. It is full of minerals like calcium, which get deposited into the drainpipe, clogging it. Too much chlorine can also be a problem. Chlorine is added to public waterworks to kill bacteria but can damage the plastic or rubber parts in the toilet. This can keep it from flushing properly, preventing a complete flush-out of debris. A blocked S-pipe, obstructed plumbing vents, or damaged sewer mains can also cause clogging. This ultimately causes leftover debris to become clogged. Whether you have a toy flushed down toilet drains or a buildup of hard water residue, you need to resolve the clog to prevent additional damage.Signs of a Clogged ToiletSeveral signs may indicate you have a clogged toilet. Be aware of these signs because plumbing issues need to be rectified quickly. One sign that your toilet is clogged is the presence or sound of bubbling. Another sign is water from the toilet backing up into another item, such as a shower, sink, or bathtub.You can sometimes see water coming out from under the toilet base. Water draining slowly from the toilet can be another sign of an issue. You may notice a bad odor when you use the toilet or puddles or water in the bathroom. These issues should be inspected by a professional to determine if the toilet needs to be unclogged.When to Call a Plumber for a Clogged ToiletWhen there is a clogged toilet issue, call a professional as quickly as possible. The longer you wait to solve the problem, the worse it is likely to get because small clogs trap more debris, causing bigger clogs. If a sewer line break is causing the problem, not dealing with it promptly can stop water flow, cause gross backups, and allow bacteria into your home. If you try DIY methods to unclog the toilet and they do not work, call a plumber to help.Toilet Clog PreventionA clogged toilet can be a real hassle. The best way to prevent dealing with this messy situation is to learn what can and cannot be flushed. The only two safe things to flush are human waste and toilet paper. Even too much of these can cause a problem. Use only enough toilet paper to get the job done. Avoid large wads of paper. While the outer amount disintegrates in the water, the hard-packed wad can sit in your drain, eventually clogging it.Never flush anything else down the toilet because it can block the pipes. Remove shelving placed above the toilet. It is common for items to fall off and into the toilet where they are accidentally flushed, causing blockages. Keep children away from toilets when unattended to reduce the risk of accidental items being flushed.One of the best ways to prevent future clogs is to watch for slow drains. This is the first sign something is keeping the water from flowing properly. Attack those slow-draining toilets immediately and avoid a clogged line or serious sewer backup. After all, what starts as a small clog or slow drain can easily become a full blockage requiring hydro jetting or clearing the main sewer line. This can be expensive, so it is important to address slow drains as soon as possible.\\n\\nFind the best plumber to unclog a toilet near me\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFind Pros\\n\\n\\nInvalid zip code\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnhancement and Improvement CostsReplace a ToiletThe average cost to replace a toilet is $425 to $900. While most clogs can be resolved without replacing equipment, some cases exist when a toilet needs replacing. Some clogs damage the integrity of the porcelain or other bowl material, making the toilet more likely to leak. It may be required to remove the toilet to access and resolve the clog, indicating the toilet needs replacement. Regardless of why the toilet needs to be replaced, it is best to do it sooner than later to protect your plumbing’s integrity.Repair a ToiletThe average cost to repair a toilet is $60 to $200, depending on the repair and how much work it entails. For example, the toilet leak repair cost is much lower than the toilet tank replacement cost if your entire tank needs to be replaced. You may need to replace the flush handle or fill system, or you might even need to repair the lines going into the drains from the toilet due to a clog or buildup. You could spend less on small repairs or spend thousands on serious replacements and repairs, depending on how quickly you address them.Sewer Line CleaningThe average sewer line cleaning cost is $150 to $600. When performing an inspection and clog removal, the plumber may realize the main sewer line needs to be cleaned with the clog removal process. This should be done regularly to ensure you do not have clogs, but it might be a way to resolve your issue. Discuss the situation with your plumber to determine the best course of action, including if a major sewer line cleaning is needed.Additional Considerations and CostsPermits. Some municipalities require service providers to obtain a working permit in their city. Other than that, no other permit or license is usually necessary for indoor work. However, a building permit may be needed if your clog originates from the main sewer line, and you must dig it up to handle the repair. Check with your local zoning office before starting this work.DIY. While small clogs can be handled on your own, it is advisable to call in a plumber in most cases. Certain chemicals attack the clog but are corrosive and can burn the skin or cause breathing issues. If used improperly, home remedies for clogged toilets can damage your toilet and pipes. Before trying a snake to unclog the drain yourself, be sure you know how to use the device or you may crack the pipe.Precautions. If the toilet is overflowing, it is usually a good idea to shut off the water at the back of the tank. However, if you notice clogs forming throughout the house or sewage seeping into sinks or tubs, shut off the main water supply until the plumber arrives. A simple clog may seem like no big deal, but it does not take much for a small plumbing issue to become serious.Landscaping. If sewer pipes cause a problem that requires digging up the yard, you may also need to enlist the assistance of a landscaper to fix the yard after the work is complete. This could include re-seeding the grass, planting shrubs, and other work. Landscapers typically charge around $50 to $100 per hour for labor and materials.Estimates. Get at least three estimates for your toilet unclogging needs. This allows you to ensure you are getting the correct service and not overpaying for it. Different plumbers may have different rates and offer different answers or solutions. It is also helpful to get a visual estimate or consultation because an accurate price is not offered until the plumber sees the job.Location. Your location affects the cost of toilet unclogging services. Plumbers have different rates in different areas. There may be different requirements or issues involving plumbing that have to be considered. You may also pay more for these services if you live farther from a provider like those in rural settings.Rental options. Many products used to unclog toilets can be rented from major home improvement stores and other locations. Some of the items a homeowner can rent include drain snakes, toilet augers, and drain cleaners. In some cases, toilet cameras can also be found for rent. This may be a good option for DIY toilet unclogging.FAQsCan a plumber unblock a toilet?Yes, plumbers have the knowledge and experience to unblock toilets.

No matter what type of toilet you have, whether it’s overflowing, clogged or just constantly running, if your commode needs repair, it’s best to call a plumber to fix the problem immediately. But, of course, that service comes with a fee. Here’s how much it costs for toilet repair and plumbing.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Often, plumbers will charge a flat rate for basic toilet repairs. One of the highest costs associated with toilet repair and toilet plumbing is the hourly rate of the plumber which can vary between $50 an hour in more rural areas and up to $200 an hour in expensive cities. Because toilet repairs are usually urgent, expect to pay more than you want to. The “priority” in “priority service” costs a premium.\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage Cost of Toilet Repair and Plumbing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage Cost of Toilet Repair and Plumbing\\n\\n\\n\\nAverage Cost$250 \\n\\nHighest Cost$400 \\n\\nLowest Cost$150 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOne of the most common toilet problems is a clog. Thankfully, it’s also typically a simple fix. While most homeowners own a plunger and may also be able to snake their toilet’s drain with a plumber’s snake, sometimes a plumber may be required for a more professional or deeper drain snaking. Most plumbers will charge a flat rate for a drain snake, which will likely average between $75 and $500.\\nWhen it comes to simpler clogs, expect to pay no more than $150, while more extensive blockages that require dismantling the toilet’s plumbing could cost between $150 and $500.\\nA DIY drain snake costs between $5 and $50, so it may be affordable for homeowners to take the first attempt at unclogging themselves.\\nToilet Repair Costs per Part\\nIf the problem with your toilet is more complicated than a clog, or if the clog requires removing the toilet or replacing a toilet part, costs will likely rise significantly. Here we’ve broken down some of the most common toilet parts that need replacing and their average cost including labor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPart Cost (including labor)\\n\\n\\n\\nFlange $75 - $200 \\n\\n Valves (fill, shut-off or flush) $75 - $200 \\n\\nWax ring/seal $50 - $150  \\n\\nTank $100 - $250 \\n\\nBowl $100 - $300  \\n\\nPipe $100 - $1,200 \\n\\nSeat $50 - $75  \\n\\nDrain $75 - $750 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFactors That Affect the Cost of Toilet Repair and Plumbing\\n\\nSome of the most significant factors affecting the cost of toilet repair and plumbing are the type of repair including the replacement part cost, the labor cost in your area, permits, other repairs and additional materials.\\nType of Repair and Replacement Part\\nThe biggest cost associated with any toilet repair is the type of repair and what kind of replacement parts will be necessary to finish the project. While an unclogging requires no replacement parts, an issue with the flange or valve can be more costly due to the complexity involved in taking apart your toilet and the material cost of any replacement parts purchased.\\nLabor\\nLabor costs remain a big factor when estimating the cost of toilet repair and will differ greatly depending on the region in which you reside. Good licensed plumbers are plentiful and cheaper in more rural areas, while big-city plumbers are often more expensive and in high demand all the time.\\nPermits\\nA simple toilet repair will not require any building permits, but if you move the toilet to a new location in your home (even across the bathroom) you will need to pull permits. A licensed contractor can handle this process for you, but you can often do it yourself.\\nOther Repairs and Additional Materials\\nIf the problem with your toilet requires a plumber to remove tiling, drywall or other parts of your home, expect a much costlier repair. It may be necessary to hire a team to remodel that part of your bathroom.\\nYour plumber may need additional materials along with specific toilet replacement parts such as tape, plumber’s putty or pipe. These costs, though not significant, can add up for larger repairs.\\n\\n\\n\\nReasons Your Toilet Might Need Repair\\n\\nThe four most common reasons your toilet might need to be repaired involve leaks, running water, a loose toilet or a slow-filling bowl.\\nLeaks\\nToilet leak repair can vary in cost. Fixing a leak can be one of the easiest and most affordable toilet repair projects or one of the most difficult and expensive. The most common place for a toilet to leak is at the wax seal. Replacing a wax seal may be as cheap as $50. Other common leak points are the tank and bowl which may cost $300 or more to repair. You should take care of leaks as soon as possible so you don’t add water damage to the list of necessary repairs.\\nRunning Water\\nA toilet that won’t stop running is another common problem. You can expect to pay between $50 and $400 to repair a running water issue. If there is too much water in your tank, it will be a quick, easy fix and may be possible to do at home. An issue with the flange or refill tube may be much more expensive if it can’t be fixed with a simple adjustment. This is not as critical an issue as a leak, but the longer you leave it the more money you will spend on your water bill.\\nLoose Toilet\\nA loose toilet is a pretty quick and easy problem to solve, but we recommend hiring a professional because an inexperienced DIY-er may make it worse or cause other problems. Expect to pay $50 to $150 to fix a loose toilet.\\nSlow-Filling\\nA slow-filling toilet will run you between $60 and $200 in costs. Most often this issue is caused by a defective filler valve and you may notice odd noises such as gurgling or whistling accompanying the slow-filling. It is usually easier to completely replace the filler valve than repair any part of that system.\\n\\n\\n\\nRepair vs. Replace\\n\\nWhile repairing a toilet often involves replacing one or more of internal parts, the question of whether you should fully replace a whole toilet or simply repair it will depend on how severe the plumbing issues are. A new toilet costs $250 to $600, inclusive of both labor and materials. The fixture itself costs between $75 and $400. Labor rates will depend on where you live and the complexity of the install. The cost of the toilet will depend on its quality, finish and any additional features like bidet attachments or heated seats.\\nWhen replacing a toilet, consider a low-flow model, an up-flush or a dual-flush toilet—all of which are better for the environment and more cost-effective.\\n\\n\\n\\nDIY Toilet Repair vs. Calling a Plumber\\n\\nSome toilet repair problems are easy enough for a handy homeowner to take on, which is good because toilet repair is often an urgent matter. If you are not confident about plumbing or you’d rather sit on the porch outside with a beer in your hand while someone else does it for you, calling a plumber can be a great choice and is especially key for larger issues.\\nIf you want to save money when hiring a plumber, figure out what the problem is first by checking other faucets and taps in your house to determine if your plumbing issue is in the whole system or isolated just to your toilet. If the problem seems to be caused by a clog, try plunging the toilet yourself or snaking the drain with an affordable plumber’s snake.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

It is fairly common for a toilet to have an issue or two, but if the same problem occurs multiple times, you should save yourself the hassle and replace the whole toilet.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much does it cost to install a toilet?\\n\\nThe cost of installing a new toilet ranges between $250 and $600 with the national average around $375. This will depend on the type of toilet, the complexity of the install and any special features or finishes the toilet you go with might include.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow much does The Home Depot charge to install a toilet?\\n\\nThe Home Depot offers a flat fee of $99 for toilet installation but certain, more expensive, toilet models may incur additional fees.\\n\\n\\n\\nCan you replace just the tank of a toilet?\\n\\nWhile you can buy a whole toilet, it is relatively common to replace the tanks and bowls separately. Make sure the manufacturer, model and color match between the two products.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow long do toilet flappers last?\\n\\nIn most cases, toilet flappers last four to five years before they need to be replaced, but chemical cleaners can shorten their lifespan to less than one year. You should replace your flapper if it deteriorates or hardens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Home. Your Decisions. Our Support.

Below is a list of the main things that could have an impact on the overall cost of the job:\\n\\nType of Blockage\\n\\nMany things can cause a blockage within your toilet, and some are easier to fix than others. A mild blockage can take as little as 30 minutes to unblock, but a more severe blockage such as a blocked toilet drain or a blockage within the pipework could take a few hours. The longer the plumber needs to spend at your property, the more you should expect to pay for the work.\\n\\nEase of Access\\n\\nThe location of the blockage can affect the overall cost of the job. A blockage within the toilet bowl U-bend is much easier to access than a blockage that is further down the waste pipe. The more difficult the blockage is to get to, the longer it will take to unblock and will end up costing more.\\n\\nLocation of Property\\n\\nYour location within the UK can have quite a substantial effect on how much you will pay to have your toilet unblocked. Plumbers in the London area can charge around £30-£100 more per day than plumbers based in other parts of the UK. So, if you are based in London, you can expect to pay more to get your toilet unblocked than someone who lives in another part of the UK.\\n\\nWhat's Involved in Unblocking a Toilet?\" metadata={'source': 'https://www.myjobquote.co.uk/costs/unblocking-a-toilet'}\n",

      "page_content='The most commonly used methods to dislodge partial blockages are toilet unblocking chemicals that break up the clog or the\\r\\n use of a plunger to dislodge the blockage.\\n\\nA plumber will likely charge between £30 - £60 to fix a partial blockage, \\r\\nbudgeting for 30 minutes of their time.\\n\\nAlthough these are relatively cheap and easy for you to rectify yourself, with the material needed costing as little as £2 - £30.\\n\\nComplete Blockage Repair Cost\\n\\nA complete blockage will become apparent when either the toilet bowl does not empty at all after flushing, or the toilet fails to refill after flushing.\\n\\nIf you suspect you know the cause of the blockage, and the location of the blockage is accessible from the toilet bowl, \\r\\nthere are a few methods that can be used to dislodge it.\\n\\nFor this type of blockage, professionals would recommend using a plunger or toilet auger to breakup or dislodge the blockage.\\n\\nDepending on the severity of the blockage, this process could take up to an hour to complete and would cost in the \\r\\nregion of £60 – £120 to fix.\\n\\nOutside Blockage Repair Cost\\n\\nSometimes the blockage is not within the toilet, but within the drainage pipes themselves, \\r\\nwhich can be very costly to rectify if the issue isn’t addressed immediately.\\n\\nPressure behind the blockage can cause pipes to collapse and can force waste materials back up into your home.\\n\\nSigns that you have an external blockage can include the toilet not flushing, external drains overflowing or noticing a \\r\\nfoul smell coming from your sinks or washing machine.\\n\\nIn the event that your drains need unblocking, you will likely require a type of professional \\r\\nrodding or jetting service to unblock the system,\\r\\nwhich will usually cost around between £100 - £200 and can take up to 2 hours to completely remove a large blockage.' metadata={'source': 'https://www.priceyourjob.co.uk/fixing-blocked-toilet-cost/'}\n",
      "page_content='Plungers are usually the go-to method of blockage removal within toilets as they are easy to use and cheap to purchase, \\r\\ncosting as little as £2 from some retail stores, to upwards of £20, \\r\\ndepending on the materials and quality of the product.\\n\\nAs with any waste disposal, you will want to make sure you have adequate protection for yourself and your property, \\r\\nso ensure you wear rubber gloves (costing around £1 - £10 a pair) and some sort of disposable material, \\r\\nsuch as newspaper, to cover the floor to protect against splashing and spillage.\\n\\nIt’s also advisable to have a bucket or container to hand in case water needs to be removed from the toilet bowl.\\n\\nWhen choosing your plunger you should consider the size of the waste outlet that you are tackling; the plunger needs\\r\\n to be large enough that it can seal around the waste pipe with no gaps.\\n\\nThis is important as plunging relies on pressure being forced down the pipes and an incomplete seal will render the plunger useless.\\n\\nOnce the correct size plunger has been selected, place inside the toilet bowl to form a seal over the waste outlet.\\n\\nDepending on the blockage you may need to add more water to the bowl to ensure the plunger head is covered.\\n\\nSlowly push the plunger down; this will gently force the air and water against the blockage and pull back sharply, careful not to break the seal.\\n\\nRepeat the process until the blockage has been cleared.\\n\\nYou can test whether the blockage has been dislodged by flushing the toilet. If it hasn’t, you can repeat the process, removing excess water if needed.\\n\\nIf plunging is unsuccessful after repeated attempts, you may need to try another method or call a professional.\\n\\nWhy Is My Toilet Blocked?\\n\\nToilet blockages can be caused by a number of things, but the most common causes are outlined below:\\n\\nFlushing Too Much Toilet Paper At One Time\\n\\nToilet paper is absorbent and so expands slightly on contact with water.' metadata={'source': 'https://www.priceyourjob.co.uk/fixing-blocked-toilet-cost/'}\n",
      "page_content='Estimates. Get at least three estimates for your toilet unclogging needs. This allows you to ensure you are getting the correct service and not overpaying for it. Different plumbers may have different rates and offer different answers or solutions. It is also helpful to get a visual estimate or consultation because an accurate price is not offered until the plumber sees the job.\\n\\nLocation. Your location affects the cost of toilet unclogging services. Plumbers have different rates in different areas. There may be different requirements or issues involving plumbing that have to be considered. You may also pay more for these services if you live farther from a provider like those in rural settings.\\n\\nRental options. Many products used to unclog toilets can be rented from major home improvement stores and other locations. Some of the items a homeowner can rent include drain snakes, toilet augers, and drain cleaners. In some cases, toilet cameras can also be found for rent. This may be a good option for DIY toilet unclogging.\\n\\nFAQs\\n\\nCan a plumber unblock a toilet?\\n\\nYes, plumbers have the knowledge and experience to unblock toilets. A plumber can handle everything from a small clog to a major blockage that a homeowner cannot handle.\\n\\nHow much does it cost to get a plumber to unclog a toilet?\\n\\nThe average charge to unclog a toilet is $200 to $700 and depends on several factors. The clog location, severity, and method used to unclog the toilet affect what you pay for this service.\\n\\nHow much does it cost for a plumber to snake a drain?\\n\\nAt a flat rate, drain snaking costs about $100 to $250 per service.\\n\\nWill a toilet eventually unclog itself?\\n\\nVery small clogs caused by excess fecal matter or toilet paper may eventually resolve themselves, but this is rare. Most blockages require some professional assistance.\\n\\nHow much does it cost to unclog a main sewer line?' metadata={'source': 'https://www.fixr.com/costs/unclog-toilet'}\n",
      "page_content='If you can see the toy you may be able to grab hold of it, but otherwise you will likely need a plunger to rescue it.\\n\\nWhere possible, try to keep the toilet lid closed to prevent items accidently dropping into the toilet pan.\\n\\nConstruction Waste\\n\\nConstruction materials, such as mortar, glues and fillers, should never be flushed down the toilet or drains, \\r\\nas they will cause difficult-to-remove blockages if they set.\\n\\nThese items should be disposed of safely in a bin.\\n\\nHow Can I Prevent My Toilet From Blocking?\\n\\nThe best way to prevent toilet blockages is to be careful about what is placed in them in the first place.\\n\\nItems such as sanitary products, wet-wipes and nappies, should be placed within bins and not flushed into the toilet system,\\r\\n preferably even when the packaging suggests they are biodegradable.\\n\\nThey can take longer to disintegrate than you might think which can cause blockages in the meantime.\\n\\nYou should regularly clean your toilet to help prevent limescale and debris build-up, including under the rim where water\\r\\n flows from using a toilet brush and suitable cleaning chemicals.\\n\\nReusable toilet brushes can be purchased for around £2-£15\\n\\nA toilet brush with replaceable brush-heads for can be bought for roughly £5, plus £5 - £10 per \\r\\npack of replacement brush heads.\\n\\nYou should only flush as much toilet paper as necessary at any one time; trying to dispose of large amounts of toilet\\r\\n paper at one time can cause blockages.\\n\\nSigns Your Toilet Needs Unblocking\\n\\nThere are a number of signs that may indicate that your toilet is blocked and that action needs to be taken in order to fix the issue.\\n\\nSlow to Flush\\n\\nIf your toilet takes longer than expected to release water from the cistern into the bowl during a flush, \\r\\nit could be an indication that the water-level within the tank is not adequate, or that there is a blockage between the tank and the toilet bowl.' metadata={'source': 'https://www.priceyourjob.co.uk/fixing-blocked-toilet-cost/'}\n",
      "page_content='Several signs may indicate you have a clogged toilet. Be aware of these signs because plumbing issues need to be rectified quickly. One sign that your toilet is clogged is the presence or sound of bubbling. Another sign is water from the toilet backing up into another item, such as a shower, sink, or bathtub.\\n\\nYou can sometimes see water coming out from under the toilet base. Water draining slowly from the toilet can be another sign of an issue. You may notice a bad odor when you use the toilet or puddles or water in the bathroom. These issues should be inspected by a professional to determine if the toilet needs to be unclogged.\\n\\nWhen to Call a Plumber for a Clogged Toilet\\n\\nWhen there is a clogged toilet issue, call a professional as quickly as possible. The longer you wait to solve the problem, the worse it is likely to get because small clogs trap more debris, causing bigger clogs. If a sewer line break is causing the problem, not dealing with it promptly can stop water flow, cause gross backups, and allow bacteria into your home. If you try DIY methods to unclog the toilet and they do not work, call a plumber to help.\\n\\nToilet Clog Prevention\\n\\nA clogged toilet can be a real hassle. The best way to prevent dealing with this messy situation is to learn what can and cannot be flushed. The only two safe things to flush are human waste and toilet paper. Even too much of these can cause a problem. Use only enough toilet paper to get the job done. Avoid large wads of paper. While the outer amount disintegrates in the water, the hard-packed wad can sit in your drain, eventually clogging it.\\n\\nNever flush anything else down the toilet because it can block the pipes. Remove shelving placed above the toilet. It is common for items to fall off and into the toilet where they are accidentally flushed, causing blockages. Keep children away from toilets when unattended to reduce the risk of accidental items being flushed.' metadata={'source': 'https://www.fixr.com/costs/unclog-toilet'}\n",
